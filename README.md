# Discord Bot Template (Python)
 This is a discord bot template made in python. The main functions of the bot can be found within the main.py file. If you wish to add commands yourself you can follow the "Ping" example I put in. The main file calls the run function in the command file once the namme of the command is mentioned in the discord chat.
